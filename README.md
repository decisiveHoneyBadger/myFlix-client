# myFlix

## Objective

To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
application will provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

## Design Criteria

# User Stories

● As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
● As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.
